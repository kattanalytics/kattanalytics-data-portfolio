# Superstore Analysis – Kathryn Starkey  
## Superstore Sales Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data from the **Superstore dataset** to demonstrate practical SQL querying, data transformation, and visualization skills.  
The goal is to extract actionable insights on profitability, customer behavior, and product performance while ensuring data consistency across the workflow.

---

### Objectives
- Build reliable SQL queries for aggregations, joins, and ranking functions.  
- Perform data cleansing and transformation for accurate reporting.  
- Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize sales, discounts, and profit trends.  
- Create a foundation that can connect to Snowflake or other warehouse systems for future scaling.

### Data Import Process

Documenting the import process ensures the dataset can be reloaded consistently, 
which is important for data reliability and reproducibility in real-world analytics workflows.

For practice, I documented two ways to load the dataset into MySQL:

**Option 1 – Import Wizard:**  
Used MySQL Workbench’s *Table Data Import Wizard* to quickly load `SampleSuperstore.csv`.

**Option 2 – SQL Script (for reproducibility):**  
Manually loaded the CSV into the `orders` table using `LOAD DATA INFILE`:

```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:/Users/Kathryn/Documents/SampleSuperstore.csv'
INTO TABLE orders
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;
```
IGNORE 1 ROWS → skips the header row.

FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' → handles the CSV format.

ENCLOSED BY '"' → ensures text fields load correctly.

### SQL Analysis Highlights
Key queries demonstrate:
- **Top-performing product categories and subcategories** by sales and profit  
- **Customer segmentation** by region and purchase frequency  
- **Average discount and profitability** correlation  
- **Year-over-year growth trends** using date-based aggregations  

All queries are located in the `/queries` folder with corresponding output samples in `/results`.

## 1. Basic Filtering and Sorting  

**Question:** What are the top 10 Customers by Total Sales?  
```sql
SELECT `Customer Name`, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM superstore.orders
GROUP BY `Customer Name`
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Result Screenshot:**
![Top 10 Customers by Total Sales](results/top_sales_by_customer_ss.png)


## 2. Aggregation
   
**Question:** What is the total profit by product category?
```sql
SELECT Category, SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit
FROM superstore.orders
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Total_Profit DESC;
```

**Result Screenshot:**
![Total Profit by Product Category](results/profit_by_category_ss.png)

## 3. Date Functions

**Question:** What is the Monthly Sales Trend?
```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(`Order Date`, '%Y-%m') AS Month,
		SUM(Sales) AS Monthly_Sales
FROM superstore.orders
GROUP BY Month 
ORDER BY Month;
```
**Result Screenshot:**
![Monthly Sales Trend](results/monthly_sales_trends_ss.png)

## 4. Subquery
**Question:** What are the Top 5 Products by Quantity sold?
```sql
SELECT Product_Name, Total_Quantity
FROM (
    SELECT `Product Name` AS Product_Name,
           SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Quantity,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(Quantity) DESC) AS rn
    FROM superstore.orders
    GROUP BY `Product Name`
) ranked
WHERE rn <= 5;
```

**Result Screenshot:**
![Top 5 Products by Quantity Sold](results/top_5_products_by_quantity_sold_ss.png)

## 5. Aggregation with Grouping

**Question:** What Regions have negative profit?
```sql
SELECT Region, SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit
FROM superstore.orders
GROUP BY Region
HAVING Total_Profit < 0
ORDER BY  Total_Profit ASC;
```

**Result Screenshot:**
![Regions with Negative Profit](results/regions_with_negative_profit_ss.png)

## 6. Window Function (ROW_NUMBER)

**Question:** Who are the top 3 customers by total sales in each region?
```sql
WITH Customer_Sales AS (
    SELECT 
        Region,
        `Customer Name` AS Customer_Name,
        SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY Region, `Customer Name`
)
SELECT Region, Customer_Name, Total_Sales
FROM (
    SELECT 
        Region,
        Customer_Name,
        Total_Sales,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Region ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC) AS rn
    FROM Customer_Sales
) ranked
WHERE rn <= 3
ORDER BY Region, rn;
```

**Result Screenshot:**
![Top 3 Customers By Total Sales in each Region](results/top_3_customers_by_total_sales_in_each_region_ss.png)

## Power BI Dashboard

To complement the SQL analysis, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard using the Superstore dataset.  
This dashboard highlights sales trends, profitability, and product performance with KPIs, filters, and visuals.
- Full dashboard screenshot (below)  
- Download the `.pbix` file here: [Power BI File](powerbi/Superstore_Data_Dashboard.pbix)

### Dashboard Preview
![Superstore Dashboard Overview](results/superstore_dashboard_full.png)
This dashboard was built using the Superstore dataset to highlight both high-level KPIs and deeper business insights.
Top row: KPI cards for Total Sales, Profit, Order Count, and Average Order Value, with slicers for Region, and Year.
Middle row: Visuals showing Sales by Region and a Yearly Sales Trend Line chart for deeper analysis.
Bottom row: A Top 10 Products chart and slicers for Region, and Year.
The layout moves from at-a-glance performance (KPIs) → comparisons across sales amd products by regions and year → detailed insights (products and trends). This mirrors how business leaders consume information: big picture first, followed by details that explain the “why.”
